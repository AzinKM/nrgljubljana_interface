Version 2.2.0
-------------

nrgljubljana_interface provides a C++ and Python
interfaces between "NRG Ljubljana" numerical
renormalization group code and TRIQS. It is
based on problem template files and does not
require Mathematica during computation.
Mathematica is only required for generating new
template files for custom Hamiltonians and 
symmetry types.

This is the initial release for this project.
